# Online Payment Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

# Project Summary
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to effectively identify fraudulent online payment transactions. Online payment fraud poses a major risk to the financial sector, leading to severe monetary losses and potential harm to a company’s reputation. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, the goal is to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time, reducing the impact on businesses and their customers.

# Key Insights
The Random Forest and XGBoost models delivered the highest performance in fraud detection, achieving strong precision and recall metrics.
Feature importance analysis highlighted that factors like payment method and transaction amount were key indicators of fraudulent behavior.
Employing ensemble methods greatly enhanced the model’s ability to generalize and identify fraud in new, unseen data.
